An experience designer with a cross-cultural background of China ðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡³, the Netherlands ðŸ‡³ðŸ‡± and Sweden ðŸ‡¸ðŸ‡ª. Constantly reaching out to experience cultural differences, and further on reflecting upon the perception between human, human and machine.

Technologies advance in an effort to bridge people closer, reduce further workload. However, do people truly feel the connectedness among each other? How do I as a designer, when experiencing these rapid updates, propose what is actually beneficial for a societal transformation?

Let's explore together! I will bring along my key competencies:

Cross-cultural design / Experience design / Design thinking / Experience prototyping
