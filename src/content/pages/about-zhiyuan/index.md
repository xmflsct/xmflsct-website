Hello, I am **Zhiyuan**, a passionate and experienced product designer with cross-cultural background of China 🇨🇳, the Netherlands 🇳🇱 and Sweden 🇸🇪. Constantly reaching out to experience cultural behavioural diversities, and further reflecting upon the perception between human; human and machine.

Technologies advance in an effort to bridge people closer, reducing workload. However, do we truly feel the connectedness among each other? How would I as a designer, when experiencing these rapid changes, propose what is beneficial for a societal transformation?

Let's explore together! I will bring along my key competencies:

- Cross-cultural design
- Experience design
- Design thinking
- Product development
