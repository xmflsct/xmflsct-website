I worked as the lead UX designer for this initiative, taking over previous global research on customer offering expectations and transform the needs into actionable MVP.

Challenges came from both internal process constraints as well as a brand new mental model of what this "mode" is about. To better understand its potentials, in store context interviews were conducted, using mock-ups to observe and empathize how customers could connect ability enhancements through digital with well-known physical presence.
